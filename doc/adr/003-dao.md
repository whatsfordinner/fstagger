# Title

This decision describes the implementation of database access for `fstagger`

# Context

`fstagger` uses a SQLite backend for storing file info, tag info and the tags assigned to each file. There are some database options I want to run for _every_ command:

1. Connecting to the SQLite DB
2. Running any migrations using `goose`

`cobra` offers `PersistentPreRun` and `PersistentPostRun` functions which are inherited by child commands. If I add the database commands to those functions I can ensure that they're run for every command. The only problem is that I cannot pass a traditional data access object to child commands.

# Decision

I will create a long-lived DAO that exists within the `db` package but isn't exported. Commands and their packages will be able to acess data via functions exported from the `db` package that use that long-lived DAO under the hood.
